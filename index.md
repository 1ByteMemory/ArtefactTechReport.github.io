## Fire Interface for the HoloLens Technical Report

### The Artefact
For my artefact I produced an augmented reality (AR) game based on the mechanic of casting a fire ball as a magic spell. In the artefact the user wears a head mounted display capable of AR to cast fire balls using hand gestures. The fire balls travel in the direction the user is facing and explode upon colliding with a real-world surface. The fire then permeates for a few seconds before fizzling out.

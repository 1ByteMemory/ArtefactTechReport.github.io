## Fire Interface for the HoloLens Technical Report

### The Artefact
For my artefact I produced an augmented reality (AR) game based on the mechanic of casting a fire ball as a magic spell. In the artefact the user wears a head mounted display capable of AR to cast fire balls using hand gestures. The fire balls travel in the direction the user is facing and explode upon colliding with a real-world surface. The fire then permeates for a few seconds before fizzling out.

### Practice Based Research
For my practice-based research I was going to have one-one-one interviews after having the users physically use the HoloLens where the users can give immediate feedback on their experience. However, due to unforeseen circumstances, I was unable to perform this type of research. So, I was forced to write up a survey and distribute that alongside a video showing what the experience would look like. With this method I was able to easily distribute the survey to a variety of people of different ages and knowledge in knowledge of games and augmented reality; unfortunately, some clarity was lost in the demonstration video as I had no access to a HoloLens at that time. 

The majority of responses do play video games and have at least had some experience in using augmented reality, mostly with using apps such as Pokémon Go, Snapchat filters and some with the PS VITA and Nintendo 3DS, although very few of them have had any experience with using the HoloLens.

Most participants found the interface to not be very exciting while the majority find the interface to be a novel use of the HoloLens and they believe that the demo clearly shows how the HoloLens is used to project fire balls into an environment. So, my conclusion from this is that the interface itself needs to be more engaging. However, these results could be tainted from the participants watching a demonstrational video of the prototype, and not experiencing the interface for themselves, so care must be taken to ensure that the interface doesn't become overwhelming. 

When writing about a negative point about the prototype, one anonymous response was “[…] feels less exciting to use one finger to trigger the action, is it possible to use the whole hand?”. The HoloLens (1st Gen) only allows for the finger gesture, although the HoloLens 2 allows for many more hand gestures that could be used. So, to improve this project I would use the HoloLens 2 to grant the use of such capabilities. 

43.8% of responses said that they didn’t find the fire ball interface to be exciting. It is possible that people thought this because they only saw a video of what the interface would look like and weren’t able to test it for themselves. To properly inform the next generation of the product I will need to have the users physically test the interface using an AB test. Test A will be what is seen in the video, and Test B will have added effects to make the fire ball more exciting. This AB test will help determine if there was a physical experience barrier, or if the interface does indeed need to be more engaging with the user.


### Justification of useing the HoloLens
From my experience of using a virtual reality headset, it is inconsistent as to how comfortable it is to use. I am unsure as to why specifically but comparing it to my experiences with using the AR headset HoloLens, where I don’t experience the same uncomfortableness, I should be able to draw some form of conclusion as to why this is the case. The HoloLens allows me to see my surroundings, whereas VR completely cuts me of from the outside world.
